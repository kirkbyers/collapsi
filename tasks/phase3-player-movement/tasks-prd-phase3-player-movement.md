### Notes

- ✅ Movement validation system refactored into modular architecture (2,227 lines → 11 focused files)
- ✅ Performance optimization achieved with <100ms validation target
- ✅ Modulo arithmetic implemented for wraparound edge calculations
- ✅ Comprehensive joker movement state machine with early completion
- ✅ Path visualization system with real-time highlighting
- Store move history in game state for debugging purposes
- Prevent all invalid moves through proactive UI validation

### Refactoring Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility (Core, Validation, Joker, Visualization)
- **Testability**: Smaller, focused functions easier to unit test
- **Performance**: Optimized validation with early exit strategies
- **Debugging**: Issues easier to locate in specific modules
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
