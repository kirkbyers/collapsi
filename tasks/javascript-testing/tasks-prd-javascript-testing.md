### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `game.js` and `game.test.js` in the same directory)
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test [path]` to run specific test files
- Jest will automatically find and run all `.test.js` files

## Task 4.7 Detailed Plan: Fix Rendering Integration Test Strategy

### Current Problem Analysis
**Status**: 22/23 test suites passing, 700/718 tests passing (97.5% pass rate)
**Issue**: rendering-integration.test.js has 18 failing tests due to complex VM-based testing approach

### Problems with Current VM-based Approach:
1. **Complex Mock Context**: Uses `vm.runInContext()` creating hard-to-debug execution environment
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Test mocks functions defined in same file (like `renderAffectedPositions`)
3. **DOM Mocking Complexity**: Heavy reliance on mocking `document` and DOM elements in Node.js
4. **Mock Synchronization**: Difficulty tracking Jest mocks vs. wrapper function calls
5. **Error Propagation**: Exceptions/failures in VM context are hard to trace

### Comparison with Working Tests:
- **ES6 Import Strategy**: `game.test.js` uses clean ES6 imports
- **Simpler Mock Strategy**: Other tests mock only external dependencies, not internal functions
- **Direct Function Testing**: Most working tests call functions directly vs. through VM context

### Alternative Testing Strategies Considered:

#### Strategy 1: ES6 Module Refactor (RECOMMENDED)
**Description**: Convert rendering-integration.js to ES6 modules
**Pros**: 
- Clean imports/exports
- Natural Jest mocking  
- Better IDE support
- Consistent with `game.test.js` pattern
- No VM complexity
**Cons**: 
- Requires refactoring source file
- May need to update dependent files

#### Strategy 2: Dependency Injection Pattern  
**Description**: Modify functions to accept dependencies as parameters
**Pros**: Easy to test, clear contracts, no globals
**Cons**: Changes function signatures, may require calling code updates

#### Strategy 3: Factory Pattern
**Description**: Create factory function returning configured functions  
**Pros**: Maintains signatures, easy injection, isolated concerns
**Cons**: Adds production complexity, requires restructuring

#### Strategy 4: Integration Test Focus
**Description**: Test via higher-level integration vs unit tests
**Pros**: Tests real behavior, simpler setup, catches integration issues
**Cons**: Less precise errors, harder edge cases, slower execution

#### Strategy 5: Simplified Unit Tests
**Description**: Keep structure but simplify test approach
**Pros**: Minimal changes, keeps architecture, quick implementation
**Cons**: May miss edge cases, still has complexity

### Recommended Implementation Plan (Strategy 1):

#### Phase 1: Convert Source File to ES6 Module
1. **Refactor rendering-integration.js**:
   - Convert to ES6 exports for all functions
   - Add proper imports for dependencies
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Update dependency loading**:
   - Add explicit imports from other modules (player.js, move-executor.js, etc.)
   - Use conditional imports for browser vs. test environments

#### Phase 2: Create New Test File  
1. **Create clean ES6 test file**:
   - Follow successful pattern from `game.test.js`
   - Use Jest's native ES6 module mocking
   - Import test utilities from existing test helpers

2. **Implement simplified mocking**:
   - Mock only external dependencies, not internal functions
   - Use Jest's module mocking for DOM APIs
   - Create focused test scenarios for each function

#### Phase 3: Test Implementation
1. **Unit tests for core functions**:
   - `executeMovWithRendering` - main integration flow
   - `renderAffectedPositions` - rendering logic  
   - `updatePlayerPawnRendering` - pawn updates
   - `highlightExecutionPath` - visual feedback

2. **Integration test scenarios**:
   - Complete move execution flow
   - Error handling and rollback
   - DOM manipulation verification

#### Phase 4: Cleanup and Migration
1. **Remove old test file**: Delete complex VM-based test
2. **Verify compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing code  
3. **Update documentation**: Update any references to module structure

### Expected Benefits:
- **97.5% test pass rate → 100% test pass rate**
- Clean, maintainable test code
- Easier debugging and development  
- Consistent with project patterns
- Faster test execution

### Estimated Impact:
- **Files to modify**: 2 (source + test file)
- **Risk level**: Low (maintains existing functionality)
- **Time to complete**: ~30 minutes
- **Test improvement**: 18 failing tests → 0 failing tests

### Key Implementation Notes:
- Current test failures include DOM mocking issues, mock function tracking problems, and VM context complexity
- ES6 module approach used successfully in `game.test.js` and other working test files
- Application functionality works correctly - only test strategy needs adjustment
- Focus on maintaining existing API while improving testability
