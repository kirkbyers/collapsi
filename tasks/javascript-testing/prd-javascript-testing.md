# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive JavaScript Testing Implementation

## Introduction/Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing suite for the Collapsi game's JavaScript codebase to enable confident development and prevent regressions. The game currently has a sophisticated modular architecture with 11 movement system modules, complete game logic, and UI integration. This testing implementation will establish a foundation for future feature development and refactoring.

**Problem**: The current codebase lacks automated testing, making it risky to make changes or add new features without manual regression testing.

**Goal**: Create a fast, comprehensive testing suite that provides confidence when making changes to the codebase.

## Goals

1. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact when making changes
2. **Development Confidence**: Enable developers to refactor and add features without fear of breaking existing code
3. **Fast Feedback Loop**: Tests should run quickly (<5 seconds) for optimal developer experience
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Focus on critical/complex areas while achieving broad coverage efficiently
5. **Future-Ready**: Establish testing patterns that scale with new feature development

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to run a comprehensive test suite in under 5 seconds so that I can get quick feedback during development.

2. **As a developer**, I want unit tests for individual functions so that I can confidently refactor internal implementations.

3. **As a developer**, I want integration tests for module interactions so that I can verify complex game flows work correctly.

4. **As a developer**, I want performance tests for movement validation so that I can ensure the <100ms target is maintained.

5. **As a project maintainer**, I want high test coverage on critical game logic so that rule changes don't introduce bugs.

6. **As a developer**, I want tests to be co-located with source code so that I can easily find and maintain relevant tests.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Testing Framework Setup
1.1. Set up Jest as the primary testing framework with Node.js execution
1.2. Configure Jest to handle ES6 modules and modern JavaScript features
1.3. Set up test scripts in package.json for running different test suites
1.4. Configure Jest for fast execution with parallel test running

### 2. Unit Test Implementation
2.1. Create unit test files co-located with source files (e.g., `game.test.js` next to `game.js`)
2.2. Test all exported functions in the movement system modules (`js/movement/`)
2.3. Test core game logic functions in `js/game.js`, `js/board.js`, `js/player.js`
2.4. Test utility functions in `js/utils.js`
2.5. Mock DOM dependencies and external dependencies for isolated unit testing

### 3. Integration Test Implementation
3.1. Create integration test directory structure: `tests/integration/`
3.2. Organize integration tests by functionality:
   - `tests/integration/movement/` - Complete movement flows
   - `tests/integration/game-flow/` - Full game scenarios
   - `tests/integration/ui-integration/` - UI interaction flows
3.3. Test module interactions within the movement system
3.4. Test complete game flows from start to win conditions
3.5. Test error handling and edge cases across module boundaries


### 4. Test Coverage and Quality
4.1. Achieve high coverage on critical areas:
   - Movement validation system (>90% coverage)
   - Game logic and rules (>90% coverage)
   - Win condition detection (100% coverage)
4.2. Focus on testing complex logic rather than simple getters/setters
4.3. Prioritize testing functions with multiple code paths and edge cases

### 5. Test Organization and Maintenance
5.1. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
5.2. Group related tests using `describe` blocks
5.3. Set up shared test fixtures and utilities for common scenarios
5.4. Create helper functions for setting up complex game states

### 6. Continuous Integration Readiness
6.1. Ensure all tests can run in CI/CD environments
6.2. Configure test output formats suitable for CI reporting
6.3. Set up test failure handling and reporting

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **End-to-End Browser Testing**: Focus on logic testing, not full browser automation
2. **Visual/Screenshot Testing**: UI appearance testing is out of scope
3. **Performance Testing**: Out of scope for this implementation
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests run in Node.js environment only
5. **Test Coverage for Simple Functions**: Don't test trivial getters, setters, or one-line functions
6. **Mocking Complex DOM Interactions**: Focus on testing game logic, not DOM manipulation details

## Technical Considerations

### Framework Choice: Jest vs Vitest
- **Jest**: Mature, well-documented, extensive mocking capabilities
- **Vitest**: Faster execution, better ES6 module support, Vite-based
- **Recommendation**: Start with Jest for stability, consider Vitest if speed becomes critical

### Mock Strategy
- Mock DOM elements and browser APIs (localStorage, etc.)
- Mock time-dependent functions for consistent test results
- Use Jest's built-in mocking for module dependencies
- Create shared mock utilities for common game state scenarios

### Test Data Management
- Create factory functions for generating test game states
- Use JSON fixtures for complex board configurations
- Implement helper functions for common assertions (valid moves, game end states)

### Performance Considerations
- Use Jest's parallel execution for speed
- Implement test grouping to run fast tests first
- Consider test sharding for large test suites

## Success Metrics

1. **Test Execution Speed**: Full test suite completes in <5 seconds
2. **Coverage Targets**:
   - Movement system: >90% line coverage
   - Game logic: >90% line coverage
   - Overall codebase: >80% line coverage
3. **Regression Prevention**: Zero undetected regressions in critical game logic
4. **Developer Adoption**: Tests are written for all new features

## Test Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Critical Path)
1. Movement validation system (`js/movement/validation/`)
2. Game rules and win conditions (`js/game.js` - `getAllPossibleMoves`, `checkGameEnd`)
3. Move execution system (`js/movement/execution/`)
4. Joker mechanics (`js/movement/joker/`)

### Medium Priority (Important Logic)
1. Board management (`js/board.js`)
2. Player positioning (`js/player.js`)
3. Path validation and utilities (`js/movement/core/`)
4. Turn management and game flow

### Lower Priority (Utility Functions)
1. Utility functions (`js/utils.js`)
2. UI event handlers (`js/ui.js`)
3. Rendering and visualization helpers

## Implementation Phases

- Integration tests for complete movement flows

### Phase 3: Game Logic Testing (Days 6-7)
- Unit tests for game rules and win conditions
- Integration tests for complete game scenarios
- Edge case testing for complex game states

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage (Days 8-9)

- Integration tests for UI interactions
- Coverage analysis and gap filling

### Phase 5: Optimization and Documentation (Day 10)
- Test suite performance optimization
- Documentation for test patterns and practices
- CI/CD integration preparation

## Open Questions

1. **Mock Strategy for localStorage**: Should we test localStorage integration or mock it completely? Mock.
2. **Test Data Persistence**: Do we need to test game state persistence, or focus on logic only? Logic only.
3. **Error Handling Coverage**: How extensively should we test error conditions and edge cases? Somewhat
4. **Test Environment Setup**: Any specific Node.js version requirements for the test environment?
