# Tasks: Phase 7 - Polish & Mobile Optimization

## Relevant Files

- `css/styles.css` - Main stylesheet containing base styles and CSS custom properties for unified theming
- `css/board.css` - Game board specific styles requiring animation enhancements and touch target optimization
- `css/mobile.css` - Mobile-specific styles needing touch target and responsive improvements
- `js/ui.js` - UI interaction handlers that may need haptic feedback integration
- `js/utils.js` - Utility functions that may need animation timing and performance helpers
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure that may need accessibility and semantic improvements

### Notes

- No build tools are used in this project - all optimizations must use vanilla CSS and JavaScript
- Animations should use CSS transforms and transitions for hardware acceleration
- Color scheme will be implemented using CSS custom properties for maintainability
- Touch targets must meet minimum 44px accessibility standards
- Performance target is 60fps on iPhone 11+ devices
