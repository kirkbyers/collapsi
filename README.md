# Collapsi Game - Phase 1

A digital adaptation of the strategic board game Collapsi, designed for mobile-first gameplay.

## Game Overview

Collapsi is a 2-player strategy game where players move pawns on a collapsing 4x4 card grid. The last player able to make a legal move wins the game.

### Game Components
- **Board**: 4x4 grid of cards (Red Joker, Black Joker, 4Ã—A, 4Ã—2, 4Ã—3, 4Ã—4)
- **Players**: 2 players with colored pawns (Red starts on Red Joker, Blue on Black Joker)
- **Movement**: Orthogonal movement (up/down/left/right) with wraparound edges
- **Card Collapse**: Starting card flips face-down after each move (becomes impassable)
- **Win Condition**: Last player able to complete a legal move wins

## Phase 1 Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Basic HTML Structure & Game Board Display

This phase implements a static 4x4 game board with:
- Responsive mobile-first design
- All 16 game cards with distinct colors
- CSS Grid layout with proper spacing
- iPhone 11+ optimization
- Portrait/landscape orientation support

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 10.1+)
- No server installation required for Phase 1

### Running the Game

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine

2. **Open the game** in your web browser:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd collapsi
   
   # Open index.html in your default browser
   open index.html
   
   # OR double-click index.html in your file manager
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use a local server** (optional but recommended):
