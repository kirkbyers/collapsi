# Collapsi Game - Phase 1

A digital adaptation of the strategic board game Collapsi, designed for mobile-first gameplay.

## Game Overview

Collapsi is a 2-player strategy game where players move pawns on a collapsing 4x4 card grid. The last player able to make a legal move wins the game.

### Game Components
- **Board**: 4x4 grid of cards (Red Joker, Black Joker, 4Ã—A, 4Ã—2, 4Ã—3, 4Ã—4)
- **Players**: 2 players with colored pawns (Red starts on Red Joker, Blue on Black Joker)
- **Movement**: Orthogonal movement (up/down/left/right) with wraparound edges
- **Card Collapse**: Starting card flips face-down after each move (becomes impassable)
- **Win Condition**: Last player able to complete a legal move wins

## Phase 1 Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Basic HTML Structure & Game Board Display

This phase implements a static 4x4 game board with:
- Responsive mobile-first design
- All 16 game cards with distinct colors
- CSS Grid layout with proper spacing
- iPhone 11+ optimization
- Portrait/landscape orientation support

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 10.1+)
- No server installation required for Phase 1

### Running the Game

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd collapsi
   
   # Open index.html in your default browser
   open index.html
   
   # OR double-click index.html in your file manager
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use a local server** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have live-server installed)
   npx live-server

   ifconfig | grep "inet "
   
   # On Windows
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Start a local server (see setup instructions above)
4. On your mobile device, navigate to: `http://[YOUR_IP]:8000`

- Try refreshing the page (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Check browser console for any error messages

### Mobile layout issues
- Verify viewport meta tag is present in index.html
- Test with Chrome DevTools device emulation first

### Cards appear unstyled
- Ensure all CSS files are loading (check browser Network tab)
- Verify file paths are correct relative to index.html
- Check for CSS syntax errors in browser console

## Contributing

**Development Status**: Phase 1 & Movement System Complete âœ…  
**Next Phase**: Complete JavaScript Game Logic Integration

## Movement System Architecture

The movement validation system has been refactored into a modular architecture for better maintainability:

- **Core Logic** (3 files, 524 lines): Fundamental movement operations
- **Validation** (3 files, 475 lines): All validation logic including optimization
- **Joker System** (3 files, 773 lines): Complete joker movement mechanics  
- **Visualization** (1 file, 122 lines): Path highlighting and preview
- **Documentation** (1 file, 102 lines): Module exports and information

### Benefits of Modular Architecture
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each file handles a single responsibility
- **Better Testing**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues are easier to locate in specific files
- **Reduced Complexity**: 2,227 lines broken into ~200-line focused files
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Team members can work on different aspects
